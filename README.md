# Project Name: Data Depth Dynamics

## Project Overview
Data Depth Dynamics is a comprehensive data analysis project exploring underwater sonar signals and financial credit default risk. This project uses machine learning algorithms and data science techniques to classify sonar signals and accurately predict credit default risks.

## Datasets
The project utilizes four main datasets:

- `sonar_train.csv` - Training dataset for sonar signal analysis.
- `sonar_test.csv` - Testing dataset for evaluating the sonar signal classification model.
- `creditdefault_train.csv` - Training dataset for predicting credit default risks.
- `creditdefault_test.csv` - Testing dataset for evaluating the credit default prediction model.

## Getting Started
To get started with Data Depth Dynamics, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab installed to run the `.ipynb` files.
3. Install necessary dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   (Note: You'll need to create a `requirements.txt` file listing all the libraries used in your project, such as `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, etc.)
4. Navigate to the `notebooks/` directory and launch the Jupyter notebooks to explore the data analysis and machine learning models.

## Running the Project
- Open `part_1.ipynb` for an introduction to the project, data preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis.
- Continue with `part_2.ipynb` for model building, training, and evaluation.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.8+
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
